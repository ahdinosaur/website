				I had the pleasure of working along side Ben during a recent web development project. This was no small time web-development project mind you, we worked together with a team of 20 developers on a multi-million dollar software build for a medical device manufacturer. Ben joined us mid-project and I was amazed at how quickly he got up to speed on both the technical and process side of the project. Within days of joining the project Ben was already getting his hands dirty, helping refactor our framework, coding new features, and making suggestions on how to improve completed components. Ben's knowledge of User interface implementation & Javascipt is second to none and he is always willing to take the time to share his knowledge with his teammates.

				On a personal note, I always found Ben to be outgoing, friendly & approachable. He tackles new challenges with a positive & professional attitude. I would recommend Ben for any web development role, especially on projects involving emerging technologies.
